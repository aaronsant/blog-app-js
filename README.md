# blog-app-js
Blogging Web App using JavaScript on the backend. Uses node.js and express.js on the backend with the body-parser and express-session modules. There is no database connected on the backend so posts are stored in an express session and are only stored temporarily.

Front end uses html (EJS) and CSS with a little bit of JQuery as well.
